## A DTO's Journey to Validation

A validation request for a Data Transfer Object (DTO) follows a clear, two-stage process: first, **pre-validation** to prepare the data, and then **core validation** to enforce rules.

### From DTO to Result

1.  **Request received:** Your controller or API endpoint receives a DTO instance.
2.  **Validator injection:** An instance of `IFluentValidator<T>` is injected and begins the validation process.
3.  **Rule gathering:** The validator retrieves all registered rules for the DTO's type from the global registry.
4.  **Pre-validation runs:** The `PreValidationValueProviderDelegate` for a member executes, allowing you to clean or transform the data (e.g., trimming whitespace or formatting values) before validation begins.
5.  **Core validation:** Each rule is executed. If a validation fails, the validator resolves the appropriate error message.
6.  **Error aggregation:** For every validation failure, a `ValidationErrorResult` is created and added to a list.
7.  **Result returned:** The validator returns a `FluentValidationResult` containing a collection of `ValidationErrorResult` instances.
8.  **Business logic:** If the validation result indicates no errors, your application can proceed with its business logic.
