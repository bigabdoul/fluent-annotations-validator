## [v2.0.0-preview.2] - 2025-08-30

This release introduces a new, more expressive **fluent API**, marking a significant 
architectural shift. This API enhances flexibility for complex and conditional 
validation, providing a more intuitive and powerful developer experience.

---

### Added

* **Conditional Validation with `When` and `Otherwise`**: The `RuleFor(...)` builder 
now supports a powerful conditional flow.
    * `When(condition, configureRules)`: This method enables you to encapsulate multiple
    validation rules that are only executed when a specified `condition` is met.
    * `Otherwise(configureRules)`: Paired with `When`, this method defines a set of rules
    that are applied if the initial condition evaluates to `false`, creating a clear 
    `if/else` validation structure.

* **Custom Validation with `Must`**: A key addition to the `IValidationRuleBuilder<T, TProp>`
is the `Must(predicate)` method, which allows developers to define custom validation
logic using a predicate (`Func<TProp, bool>`) that operates directly on the member's
value. This method fully integrates into the fluent chain, enabling complex rules that 
extend beyond standard data annotations.

* **Pre-Validation Value Providers**: Introduced a new mechanism to modify or retrieve a member's value before validation. This is useful for data preparation, normalization, or fetching values from external sources.
    * Added `PreValidationValueProviderDelegate` to define the value-gathering logic.
    * Introduced the fluent methods `IValidationTypeConfigurator<T>.BeforeValidation(...)` and `IValidationRuleBuilder<T, TProp>.BeforeValidation(...)` to easily configure pre-validation logic.
    * The `PendingRule<T>` and `ConditionalValidationRule` classes were updated with a `ConfigureBeforeValidation` property to support this feature.

---

### Changed

* **Preemptive `Rule(...)` Overload**: The existing `Rule(...)` method has been enhanced.
It now accepts an optional `RuleDefinitionBehavior` enum, which by default causes it to 
preemptively replace all previously registered rules for the specified member before 
adding the new ones. This behavior makes it ideal for explicitly overriding previous 
configurations.

* **Non-preemptive `RuleFor(...)`**: This new method provides a non-destructive way to 
add rules. It returns a new, type-safe builder (`IValidationRuleBuilder<T, TProp>`), 
allowing you to chain validation methods and conditional logic without overriding 
existing rules for the same member.

* **Dependency Removal**: The dependency on the `FluentValidation` package has been 
removed. All references to `IValidator<T>` should be replaced with `IFluentValidator<T>`.

---

### üß™ Tests

* **Comprehensive Unit Tests**: Added a full suite of unit tests to validate the functionality of the new `BeforeValidation` methods, covering correct delegate assignment, value modification, and duplicate configuration error handling.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Other

* **Added MemberInfo Extensions**:
    * `GetValue()`: A new extension method to retrieve a member's value using reflection.
    * `SetValue()`: A new extension method to set a member's value using reflection.
    * `TrySetValue()`: A non-throwing version of `SetValue()`, which returns a boolean indicating success.

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Refactors

* **Improved `EnsureSinglePreValidationValueProvider` Logic**: The method now uses a unified LINQ query to check for duplicate pre-validation delegates, which is more readable and efficient.
* **Unified Rule Base Class**: Extracted common properties from `PendingRule<T>` and `ConditionalValidationRule` into a new `ValidationRuleBase` to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.

## [v2.0.0-preview1] - 2025-07-25

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a **preview** release. API surface and behavior may evolve in later stable builds.

### Features

- **Multi-attribute validation support**
  - Processes all `[ValidationAttribute]`s per property with conditional overrides
- **Fluent DSL configurator**
  - Introduced `ValidationConfigurator` for chaining conditional logic, culture, and resource bindings
- **Localized messaging engine**
  - Lookup via `.resx`, static resource classes, and fallback text
- **Convention-based discovery**
  - Auto-registers DTOs and message mappings using assembly scanning
- **Pluggable `IValidationMessageResolver`**
  - Allows custom lookup strategies or fallback policies

### Architectural Overhaul

- Removed all legacy APIs (single-rule registry)
- Restructured rule registry for multi-message hydration
- Separated configuration DSL from validation evaluation pipeline

### Internal Improvements

- Enhanced diagnostics for missing message keys
- Fully deterministic builds with Source Link + `.snupkg` symbols

---

## [1.2.2] - 2024-10-15

- Patch for `.Build()` fallback behavior
- Warning on multi-attribute limitation
- Culture-scoped resource fallback improvements

## [v1.2.2] - 2025-07-23

### Fixes

- Implicit rules are now generated for `[ValidationAttribute]`s when `.When(...)` is omitted
- Culture and resource bindings are synthesized correctly using `WithCulture(...)` and `WithValidationResource(...)`

### Architecture

- Introduced `ValidationConfiguratorRegistry` and `ValidationTypeConfiguratorBase` to support centralized, contextual rule inference
- `IImplicitRuleResolver` now orchestrates fallback metadata using fluent config
- Improved clarity and discoverability in `DataAnnotationsValidator`

### ‚ö† Known Limitations

> Multi-attribute validation is not yet supported.  
> Only the last rule per property is processed ‚Äî remaining attribute failures are ignored.  
> This will be addressed in **v2.0.0** with full error aggregation.

---

## [v1.2.0] - 2025-07-22

### Scoped Localization + Resilient Fallbacks
