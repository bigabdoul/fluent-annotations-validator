### Solution Structure

- Removed legacy `AspNetCore.Tests` project; unified test coverage under `FluentAnnotationsValidator.Tests`

- Enabled chaining methods: `.When(...)`, `.And(...)`, `.Except(...)`, `.AlwaysValidate(...)`
- Added metadata overrides: `.WithMessage(...)`, `.WithKey(...)`, `.Localized(...)`
- Fluent transitions via `.For<TNext>()` and finalization with `.Build()`
- Buffered rule registration for safer message chaining
